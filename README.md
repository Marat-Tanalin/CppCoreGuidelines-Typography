# C++ Core Guidelines (typography-correct)

A typography-correct version of the [C++ Core Guidelines](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines): dashes (`—` instead of `-` and `--`), quotation marks (`“”` instead of `""`), line breaks between a quotation and its source/author.

Based on the revision [c7c5614](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/commit/c7c5614a4257810cb66f1997cd2f9a0ba6368f55) (2017-02-13).

Only C++ Core Guidelines themselves, without nested directories with PDFs etc.
